a shortest path model:
The solution is also obvious, each intersection is split into four:
0 1
2 3
Then add a dimension to indicate whether has pass through red light
The total number of points that is 29 * 29 * 4 * 2 = 6728, so we need nlogn dijkstra
Reprocessing traffic lights and the way go acorss, the code is basically completed
