Group
Description
	There is a sequences of N numbers, cut them into no more than K groups without change there order, and each group at least L numbers. Calculate the sum of all the groups' value. From left to right, the value of the i-th group is the the sum of all numbers in the group multiply i. Give me the minimum sum.

Input
	The first line is a number T indicate the number of test cases.(T < 20)
	Then T cases, for each case:
	First line is three numbers N, K, L as description.(1<=L<=N<=20000, 1<=K<=100)
	Then N numbers ranged in [-1000, 1000].

Output
	For each case, output the minimum sum in a line.

Sample Input
2
5 3 1
3 -2 -1 -4 5
5 3 2
3 -2 -1 -4 5

Sample Output
-1
1

Hint
To get the best answer you can try:
Case 1: 
(3)(-2 -1 -4 5) or (3)(-2)(-1 -4 -5)
Case 2:
(3 -2)(-1 -4 5)
