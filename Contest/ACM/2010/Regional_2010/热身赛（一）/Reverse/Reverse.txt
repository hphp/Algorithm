Reverse 
Given an array of integers, your job is to print it in the reverse order. For example:
Given an array of 1,2,3,4,5 you should output 5,4,3,2,1.
Input 
Input contains multiple test cases. The first line is a integer T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case is a integer N, the number of elements in the array. Then a line with N integers follows.
Output
For each test case, print the reversed order of the input array.
Sample Input
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output
5 4 3 2 1
