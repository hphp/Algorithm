You have known how to find the longest common subsequence of two sequences. Today you are not going to solve this problem, but to find the shortest subsequence that is not in a sequence. For example, given a sequence of "ABCDEFG", the shortest subsequence not appearing in the sequence is BA, CB, CA and so on.
Input
The input contains multiple test cases, each a line consisting of a sequence of capital letters. The length of each sequence is N(2<=N<=999999).
Output
For each test case, output the length of shortest subsequence that not appearing in the sequence given.

Sample Input
ABCDEFG
DADAADDD
CDBBDCB

Sample Output
