There is a table, on which some plates were put in a circle. Some apples were put in the plates. Let's play a game. For each plate, separate the apples into two parts. For example if a plate containing M apples, put M/2 apples into the lefthand plate and the rest to the righthand plate. Note that if M is a odd number, then M/2 equals (M-1)/2. Plates are numbered from 1 to N in counter-clockwise. The lefthand plate is the plate whose number is smaller. The lefthand plate of plate numbered 1 is the plate numbered N. Given the number of apples in each plate(1,2,...N), output the the number of apples in each plate when game is over.
Input 
The input contains multiple test case. The first line of each case contains a integer N, the number of plates on the table, followd by N integers representing the number of apples in the plates(1,2,...N).
Output
For each test case print the number of apples in each plate(from numbered 1 to N) when game is over.
